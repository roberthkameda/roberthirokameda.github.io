				      <p><h6>As a designer, I learned that the most effective way to interview potential users was to visually observe and take notes on how they emotionally and physically react (ease/frustration) to every objective they’re asked to complete.</h6></p>

				      <p><h6>Certain questions with the <i>appropriate diction</i> can also provide designers with information on other competitors in the market. In this step, designers will create the <i>competitive market analysis</i>, which will determine their similarities & differences with other companies, and help them distinguish themselves from the rest of the wolf-pak.</h6></p>

        	<div class="mypgoalb">
          		<p><h6>Once all the quantitative and qualitative data from the <b>RESEARCH</b> stage are gathered and organized, the designer will have a <i>‘calling’</i> moment or <b>GOAL</b> of the product's caliber. At this point, it’s possible to create the skeleton structure of the final product, also called the MVP: the minimum viable product. I learned that starting the project with main features that are considered as a priority can lead to a more clearer path to user-gratification.</h6></p>

    	<div class="eight columns offset-by-two">
        	<div class="mypstorytellingb">
          		<p><h6>I personally love the <i>User Persona</i> phase of the <b>STORYTELLING</b> stage, simply because it allows me (the designer) to <i>empathize</i> and create our own personal story with the users on an intimate level. As a designer, I learned that its important for me to approach them with a spirit of <i>‘aloha’</i> as if conversing with our <i>loved ones or that special someone</i> you deeply care about and have the eagerness to dive in to their imaginative world and holisitcally analyze their <i>painpoints and preferences.</i></h6></p>	

          		<p><h6>Once the <i>User Persona</i> phase is complete, and if the designer can visualize her/himself using the device, next comes the <i>User Story & User Flow,</i> where all the possible actions of the user is jotted down on tools such as draw.io or note pads (anything that makes the designer comfortable while digging deep into the minds of what an ideal user would like to do on an organic or digital application. It’s also important to note that prioritizing the list from <i>most important to least important</i> can provide the designer an idea of which direction the product should head towards, and in some cases re-define, and re-verify the <i>MVP.</i></h6></p>

          		<p><h6><b>BRANDING</b> allows designers to let their creative outlets take in charge for most of the work, yet still require a business mindset, since the end-product would have to ultimately focus on the user.</h6></p>

				      <p><h6>Through the studies I had at BLOC & my personal experience with all realms of art, I’ve learned that focusing on creating simple and authentic brand logos, color palettes & typographies that synchronises well with the philosophy, theme, and culture of the product (as well as the company), are what makes branding effective and visually appealing.</h6></p>

          		<p><h6>Starting off the <b>PROTOTYPE</b> stage with Low-Fidelity affirms the user’s basic decision making skill when observing and initiating specific actions while on the device. The goal here is to make the visual design of the product as concrete as possible, in order to prevent from creating a clickable prototype that will unfortunately frustrate the user.</h6></p>

				      <p><h6>From my experience, I noticed that I went through many iterations and changes during the High-Fidelity phase compared to the low fidelity phase, simply because of the endless variations of how a designer can visually edit the contents, texts and images. But I believe, empathizing with the user’s intrinsic needs and focusing on the major components (MVP) of the product are what makes the high-fidelity prototype so effective and attractive.</h6></p>

        	<div class="myptestb">
          		<p><h6>In the <b>TEST</b> stage, the main goal is to gather as much feedback as possible (both good and bad) in order to modify and/or validate the product. I see this as an indirect and genuine interaction between a random user you’ve never met telling you brutually honest opinions on the designer's IQ (and possibly EQ?). Sometimes it can emotionally hurt designers for their effort, but I see this as an opportunity to go back and grind through the process till the users show gratification.</h6></p>

        	<div class="mypiterationb">
          		<p><h6>No one’s perfect, and although designers are a breed of human beings that crave perfection in all aspects of life, we’re not perfect as well. This means, <i>iterating</i> the whole project, double-checking whether you've missed anything, and reviewing if something isnt right can save a designer from more trouble when the product is launched, and fortunately prevent receiving bad reviews.</h6></p>

              <p><h6>In my case, at that moment, I feel nothing but satifisfaction. I’m proud of my work and my dedication in solving a stranger’s problem, and that’s what drives me to continue working on the next product, so that the users of that device won’t have to go through the pain anymore that I can genuinely <b><i>empathize</i></b> with.</h6></p>
